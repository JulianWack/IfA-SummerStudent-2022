# IfA-SummerStudent-2022
This directory contains the project I worked on as a Summer Student at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. The main analysis is contained in the folder `fitmodel_densitysplit/` while the remaining ones document intermediate steps I took to arrive at the final work flow.
Specifically, in `tutorials/` I gain familiarity with *nbodykit* and computing power spectra which I then utilize on an *eBOSS* mock catalog which is documented in `explore_eBOSS_powerspectrum/`. Lastly, `explore_fitting_methods/` contains some preliminary methods of fitting a model for the redshift space power spectrum to data.

All computations have been performed on the IfA's computing cluster *Cuillin*. After describing the rquired set up, I detail the workflow of the main analysis which is described in more detail in the project report which is located in `fitmodel_densitysplit/reports`.
